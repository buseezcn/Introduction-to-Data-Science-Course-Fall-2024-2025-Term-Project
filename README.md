# Introduction to Data Science Course Fall 2024-2025 Term Project
My name is Buse Ã–zcan, and for this project, I plan to work on my "Netflix Viewing History" data. This project's aims to analyse the Netflix viewing history data using data analysis and  visualization.

# Descriptio of the Dataset 
The data set that I'm using has information on the name of the show, the episode, and the date that I watched each specific content since 2020. I obtained the data from Netflix which lets the users download their data from their website in the format of an Excel(CSV) file. 

# Project Plan
For this project, I aim to:
1) Form a hypothesis on the contents that I repeatedly watched over  specific periods. For instance, identifying trends in the genres I consistently enjoyed over the years.
2) Compare the data from weekdays versus weekends to explore any correlation with workload or busier schedules.
3) To explore my how my viewing habits differ through seasons.
4) To determine the length of binge-watching sessions.
